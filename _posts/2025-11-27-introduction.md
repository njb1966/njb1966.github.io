Civilizations are not static. They emerge, consolidate, transform, fragment, and sometimes collapse. This project asks why—and how—we can know. I’ll approach the question the way I learned to write history: by reading closely, citing sources, and making arguments that are transparent about evidence and limits.[^1]

## What I mean by “civilization”
“Civilization” is a contested term. I use it pragmatically to mean a large, enduring social order with:
- Shared institutions (political, legal, religious), 
- A complex economy (surplus extraction, trade networks, urban centers),
- Cultural continuities (languages, texts, practices) recognizable over generations.

This is a working definition, not a gatekeeping device. When a case doesn’t fit neatly, I’ll say so and explain why that matters for the argument.

## What counts as “rise” and “fall”
- Rise: growth in scale and complexity—population, cities, administration, long-distance trade, and cultural production.
- Fall: not simply “the end,” but sustained loss of complexity and capacity (e.g., political fragmentation, reduced specialization, demographic contraction).[^2]

“Collapse” implies a relatively rapid and durable loss in socio-political complexity. Many societies do not collapse; they transform or decentralize.

## How I’ll argue
- Sources: I will cite primary sources when possible and lean on recent secondary scholarship for synthesis and debate. Short footnotes point to evidence; each post ends with a References section.
- Method: I’ll balance narrative history with comparative frameworks (environmental stress, institutions, warfare, networks, legitimacy). Models are tools, not truths.
- Causation: I’ll avoid monocausal explanations. Most rises and falls are multicausal, path-dependent, and mediated by institutions and ideas.[^3]
- Uncertainty: I’ll mark where evidence is thin or interpretations are contested.

## What to expect here
- Foundations: short essays defining terms and methods (e.g., complexity, legitimacy, empire vs. civilization).
- Case studies: multi-part series (e.g., Old Kingdom Egypt, Neo-Assyria, Rome, Abbasids, Angkor, Song–Yuan transitions, Classic Maya).
- Themes: environment and infrastructure; trade and institutions; state capacity and fiscal-military systems; social conflict and elite overproduction; ideology and legitimacy.
- Reading notes: summaries of key books and debates, with pros/cons and further reading.

## How to read and discuss
- Each post includes a table of contents, footnotes, and a brief bibliography.
- Comments are open for thoughtful, sourced discussion. Be specific, cite where you can, and assume good faith. Disagree with arguments, not people.

## A starting hypothesis
Civilizations tend to rise when institutions can mobilize resources, coordinate knowledge, and legitimize authority at relatively low social cost; they tend to fall when those same institutions become brittle—unable or unwilling to adapt to shocks (ecological, fiscal, military, epidemiological) while maintaining legitimacy and capacity.[^4] The interesting work is in the details: which shocks, which institutions, which adaptations, and which timescales.
